# Multi-Model-Neural-Style-Transfer
Course Project for CSL-4020 Deep Learning, IIT Jodhpur. For the project we have implemented 3 different Models for Image Style transfer and deployed them all inorder to see realtime results and performance. We have also added PicsArt API support to compare our results with an insdustry level API.

# Getting Started
To run the code, we prefer you create an environment and then run the application there.

To do so run the following command in the project root 
```
pipenv shell
```

### Dependancies
All the dependancies are mentioned in requirements.txt, and can be installed into the shell environment using : 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the streamlit app
To run our app using streamlit locally, you can run the below commands : 
```
streamlit run deployment.py
```
